      <DefaultText>Two floating cones whirl and spin deliriously around each other, giggling like children being tickled. The air around them smells of sweet, burning leaves. 

{SOUND: We should hear the giggling sounds throughout this dialogue, though we should also hear them outside the dialogue when we approach the cones. Alex, I'm not sure how you want to handle this.}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You manage to graze one of them with the tip of your finger. "Rorn," a voice says, and your vision is stolen from you. 

A moon hangs over you, but it is not the one you recognize. It's black and in a pearl-white sky. Thick, flat asteroids orbit it like petals in the wind. You feel questing tendrils at your ankle, and the hot wind on your face smells of scorched hair and grief.

      <DefaultText>The cones greet your question with a split second of hushed silence, following by delighted peals of helpless giggling. 

{SOUND: As noted in the text, the giggling should stop of a second, then resume (maybe a little more hysterical at first).}</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They aren't *for* anything. They're from one of the worlds before this one."

Aligern rubs a hand along his stubbled jaw. "Sometimes, the numenera will do something useful. Sometimes, they'll turn you inside out. And sometimes, they don't do a damn thing that makes sense."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see Oom's reflection in their gleaming surfaces as they dance and find you can't look away. 

"Rorn," a voice says from the space between the cones, and your vision blurs and goes dark. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The cones have brought you once again to the scarred landscape with black moon above, and the pearl-white sky. The silent, burning air claws at your throat. 

Tendrils touch your ankle once more, and this time, you turn. It's Oom, cowering at your feet. The creature was here all along.

      <DefaultText>Wavering on your feet, you open your eyes, unaware that you'd closed them. The cones continue their merry dance as if nothing had happened. 

You look down at Oom. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You kneel, offering your hand to Oom and it folds tendrils around your palm, shaking. You close your fist around them. It seems like the right thing to do. 

Then, you sense movement above you, in the pale sky. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At first glance, it seems like a hole in the air, dark as the Void above. But no. Bruised light pours from the hole, folding into the suggestion of a hooded figure, vast as planets. 

The Sorrow. It is here, and it sees you. The shadow of it races across the land, a wall of black like a tidal wave...

Oom tugs at you again, and you fall back, back, through the land itself, into light. Into daylight. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Its eyes are circles, but the surfaces of them are textured and bent, like a page of paper folded into thousands of shapes. 

As you watch, a ripple spills from their center, a flower unfurling, and...

Something unfolds in your gut, and Oom's eyes gleam. </DefaultText>
