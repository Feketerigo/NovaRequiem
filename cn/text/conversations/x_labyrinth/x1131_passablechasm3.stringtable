      <DefaultText>You look at the gap, and vertigo assails you. Jump this? Impossible. You'll need a bridge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>If you had a way to bridge this gap... wait. Maybe the metal struts you pulled from under the statue could help.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Each of the one-meter struts is actually like a scroll - thin metal rods that pull apart, with a silvery netting of incredible tensile strength between them. If connected, these could perhaps create a long bridge suitable for some of the chasms in this room. The ends of the struts seem to have a rotating-gear mechanism attached to them, but you don't see any immediate way to connect them together.</DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>With the proper manipulation - twisting, turning, and pulling - and some fortuitous placement of the struts, you manage to assemble a strange device. When you pull the rods to the side, that silvery mesh creates a walkable surface. Shake it forward, you've got a bridge about five meters long. Snap it back, and it collapses into an easily carried single strut. You're the proud owner of a collapsible bridge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something swims to the front of your mind: it's a collapsible bridge, one of the creations of the ancients. You just have to connect the struts in a certain order with the proper twists and turns, and you'll have a bridge that looks like it span about five meters.

You do this, and now you are the proud owner of a collapsible bridge.</DefaultText>
