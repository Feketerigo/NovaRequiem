      <DefaultText>These transdimensional entities look like shadowy reflections of an angular, toothy humanoid, and the common folk believe them to be ghosts. They can phase in and out of reality at will, and they seek sources of transdimensional energy to feed upon. Beyond that, their motives are uncertain. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A dour explorer and former Aeon Priest, with living, intricately designed tattoos that writhe across his forearms, Aligern thinks you might be the Changing God. He is watching you closely. He can pull the tattoos from his arm as if they were wires under his skin, using them in battle to defend himself and his companions.

He wears a faded grey duster that buttons from the neck down to the waist. It has a number of pockets, bulging with small pieces of equipment.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>These bipedal herd animals are common pack and riding animals. Their small forelimbs and tiny claws keep them from being much of a threat to their handlers, and their generally docile natures make them ideal for long journeys – even across worlds and through the Maws of the Bloom.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Only the most wretched and unfortunate people become permanent residents of the Bloom. Some are exiles, criminals, or madmen who were forced to flee the city of Sagus Cliffs. Others are vagrants with nowhere else to go. A few came here from far away – stumbling into a portal, perhaps – and found themselves trapped in the Bloom, with no hope of making their way back home. Eventually, the Bloom will devour them all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Some people claim to know the ways of the Bloom. They've learned its tubes and byways, explored its stinking slums, and discovered what its Maws like to eat. Some even say that the Bloom favors them, opening passageways to take them where they want to go. Such people often hire themselves out as Bloom-guides, earning money by providing advice and direction to merchants and explorers. Their careers rarely last long, of course – the Bloom's favor is almost always short-lived.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Bloom-slaves are former criminals and convicts from the city of Sagus Cliffs. To pay their debt to society, some choose Bloom-slavery instead of prison or execution. They are auctioned off to merchants and explorers who use them to open the Bloom's Maws. Once a Bloom-slave has been fed to a Maw, they are free... that is, assuming they are still alive and mostly intact.</DefaultText>

Usually they surround Maws, but sometimes clusters of tongues exist on their own, especially in the deeper chambers of the Bloom. If you draw too near to a mass of Bloom-tongues, their voices will intrude upon your mind.</DefaultText>

In the remote past, this place was a crossroads in some predecessor city, built by alien hands. More recently, the Changing God seems to have discovered this place and turned it into a secret refuge or laboratory. Inexplicably, the chamber is filled with breathable air, probably supplied by one of the Changing God's devices.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For hundreds of years, the Cave of Last Words was a thieves' bolt-hole, a place for the criminal element to hide from the law. It was also the site of countless suicides, where desperate people spent their last moments before throwing themselves into the sea. A great many of them chose to leave their final thoughts on the walls – words of despair, introspection, and rage. The Cave has, of late, been your sister Matkina's home as she sank deeper and deeper into paranoia and dementia.</DefaultText>

She formed a unique bond with the Bloom, and used that bond to start a slave rebellion that ultimately spilled into Sagus Cliffs. The slaves brought down the city's government and toppled its empire, installing Chila as their autarch. Ever since, Sagus Cliffs has been governed by those who trace their lineage to Chila's slave companions. Statues of Chila depict her with silver skin and a massive war hammer.</DefaultText>

They seek to "free" the spirits of the living from the prisons of their bodies. The Children use the blood of their victims to draw the symbol of the Endless Gate. If the Gate opens, the cultists hurl their screaming victims into the nightmare beyond. The Children pray to the entity within the Endless Gate in the hope that it will calm the turmoil in their own lives – or that it will grant them its power.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Church of the Changing God – at least its Sagus Cliffs chapter – venerate the Changing God as a literal deity, a man who has transcended mortality. They view castoffs as facets of his godhood. Its followers study the Changing God's exploits and seek to gain a deeper understanding of his actions so that they can apply his lessons to their lives. He is a symbol of enlightenment and knowledge to them, and they believe that by emulating him, they can heal the Ninth World of its ills.</DefaultText>

At its heart stands the Clock, the machine once said to have unmoored the city in time during an invasion. All manner of public events happen here – traveling religious revivals, executions, performances, and more. It sits near the bottom of the city, very near the Reef of Fallen Worlds.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sometimes the Bloom's Maws break free of its body and fragment into smaller, autonomous creatures. These ravenous horrors are known as corpuscular maws. They consist of a small central core, containing a tiny portal to another time or place, surrounded by knots of Bloom-flesh that form into arms and tendrils. The "arms" serve as a means of locomotion as well as attack.</DefaultText>

They use their sharp mandibles, talons, and claws to make short work of those who intrude on their nests.

      <DefaultText>Centuries ago, the Changing God and his castoffs worked together against the Sorrow. He and the First Castoff were especially close... until the day when a disagreement poisoned their relationship. The disagreement became an argument, which became a struggle, which became a battle and then a war. The castoffs chose sides, devoting their tremendous powers and talents to bloodshed. Some sided with the Changing God, believing that he had a plan to stop the Sorrow's genocide, or from a loyalty to the man responsible for their creation. Others sided with the First, believing that she had their best interests at heart against a fundamentally selfish creator. 

The two sides fought with all the weapons at their disposal, always to a draw, until the Changing God's armies suddenly began to suffer defeat after defeat. He discovered that his weapons were worthless, for the First had found the Reconciler of Truth, a device that could collapse multiple realities. He sought – and found – a counter in Heaven's Rejoinder, and the overlapping realities of their effects have torn time in the battlefield, parallel truths rolling and twining around each other. 

A century ago, the First sought to end the battle and strike a decisive blow against one of the Changing God's mercenary companies, the Sand Knights. Her lieutenant, Paj Rekken, was charged with leading an assault on one of the Sand Knights' fortresses, and she gained entry just as the First was torn apart in a coruscation of energies. Rekken did not know the First had been destroyed and used the Reconciler to snap the realities together, maintaining victory over the Sand Knights. By the time Rekken learned of the First's death, the First was irrevocably lost. The battle continues to divide the castoff community, and mercenaries still flock to the battlefield, but the Changing God has moved on.</DefaultText>

Erritis is an unusually attractive young man, and his guiding star is to have as much excitement in his life as possible. Erritis doesn't plan, he doesn't do "tactics," and he doesn't like thinking things through because, really, what has that ever done for anyone, anyway? Point him toward a catastrophe, and let him go!

Their greatest desire is to achieve union with the Bloom. They want only to serve the Bloom, to be brought to its innermost heart. They wear the Bloom's flesh as clothing and wear no shoes, so that they can touch their god at all times. They believe that being devoured by the Bloom is a mark of their deity’s favor, and they actively seek to be eaten.</DefaultText>

The Ghibra communicate telepathically in a language they call Colosh Ny'kul – the word of Ny'kul. They frequently speak the Truth as well, for they believe in maintaining relationships with the world outside their watery bubble."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nowhere is the evidence of ancient civilizations more apparent than in the Reef of Fallen Worlds. In one section of the harbor, forgotten structures and abandoned war automatons break the surface of the water. This is prime pick for brave scavengers, but the place hides significant dangers for the unwary and the unlucky.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You found Rhin hiding from slavers in a pile of rubbish in Cliff's Edge. 

The poor child has a clearly visible head wound, and she says she came from another world. She claims to talk to gods and carries their totems in her pouch. Is she insane, or does she truly hold some latent power? Whatever her truth, she looks to you for her survival.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sagus Cliffs is one of the oldest human cities in Greater Garravia, built upon the ruins of more ancient metropolises. It occupies the headland overlooking Garravia Sound, with switchbacks and cutouts in the bluffs creating broad avenues that wind down to the harbors. Humanity has filled the old streets with their own ramshackle constructions, building wherever they can find a place to stake their claim. Strange towers and remnants of lost worlds pock the city here and there, and old machines still hum in the artificial caverns beneath the city. It is in these caverns that you see the city's true geological strata – the detritus of forgotten times.  Some neighborhoods close to the cliffs' edges are in danger of falling into the bay below. Every year, the city loses a little ground and a few more lives.

Once the heart of the Sagus Protectorate, the city's fortunes have slipped, its territory shrinking to a small pocket of land surrounding the city.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The people of Sagus Cliffs are laborers, merchants, artisans, entertainers, bureaucrats, vagrants, and criminals. Many are descended from the first people who settled here almost a thousand years ago. They're quite accustomed to the weird artifacts that are scattered about their city, but they're wise enough to avoid them. At least, most of them are.

      <DefaultText>You found this young woman's corpse beneath the wreckage of a collapsed house in Cliff's Edge. When you first saw her, she dragged you into the Labyrinth of your mind, where she appeared as the shadowy outline of a woman. You found a puzzle box that was precious to her in life, allowing her to manifest as a ghost of her former self, but she is still just a memory... a reflection that belonged to another castoff.</DefaultText>

They wander the Ninth World, seeking news of machine intelligences for some inexplicable reasons of their own. Silver orphans cannot speak, so they typically communicate through gestures and drawings.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For centuries, the Slave Families have ruled Sagus Cliffs. They claim to be descended from the slaves who followed Chila the Great to victory over the old bosses of the city. The leaders of each family form the governing Council of the city, which seems simultaneously competent and disinterested in the affairs of the common people. Most members of the Council are content to wield power without drawing attention to themselves, but every rule has its exceptions. One such exception is Yars Vuntgen, a fat, yellow-skinned aristocrat who fancies himself a rabble-rouser.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sticha are large, insectoid creatures. They are both organic and metallic, using their powerful digging claws to tunnel through rock. This activity generates piezoelectric energy that they feed upon. Sticha hatch from eggs and dig "death tunnels" when they are ready to die. They communicate via gestures, clicks and whistles, and a complex pheromonal language.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before humanity emerged on earth about a thousand years ago, the Tabaht ruled Greater Garravia. They believed that conflict clarified them, and they thought of themselves as the perfect fighting force. Their chained god, an enslaved machine intelligence called the Underspine, guided them and prophesied their future. They claimed to be the chosen people of New Earth and destroyed any who dared stand against them. 

That is, until they met the humans at Sagus Cliffs. This defeat led to their ruin, and when a massive detonation destroyed the Underspine, the Tabaht were finished. Only the Genocide remains, the last remnant of a forgotten people.</DefaultText>

Lights flicker within the crystals, some of which have strange, intricate shapes. The Ascension's sun is small and distant, leaving it in a cold, perpetual twilight. Explorers and merchants occasionally venture here, but they are few, and rarely stay for long.</DefaultText>

Its tendrils anchor it to the valley's walls – but they also reach through time and dimensions. Where it anchors its tendrils, portals open to far-off places, and explorers who dwell within the Great Devourer rush to take advantage of the  distant worlds and dimensions it unlocks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The landscape, culture, and history of Sagus Cliffs have been shaped in innumerable ways by the Changing God. At one point in the distant past, he was a respected researcher and scientist, albeit flawed and selfish. But unlike most mere humans, the Changing God is not confined to a single lifetime.

For centuries, the Changing God has continued his existence by transferring his consciousness into bodies of his own creation, casting off the many vessels that have held his mind. He has moved from life to life, whether to avoid pain, injury, or death, or to seek new sensations and experiences. 

What he didn't realize – at first – was that the bodies he left behind, though often left severely damaged, were not empty. Each time he tore his mind from one of these husks, a new consciousness was born inside – a new person with their own thoughts and dreams.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Ninth World contains realms of wonder and beauty – and places of utter, mind-destroying horror. The Endless Gate is one such place, a doorway that leads to a being of infinite hunger. Those with great psychic potential draw its attention. One such is the castoff Inifere, abandoned in the Endless Gate – and his travails have brought him worshippers who venerate the Gate's power. The Children of the Endless Gate seek to liberate their hellish master in exchange for a sliver of its unfathomable power.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Fifth Eye is an abandoned pumping station from a prior world, now used as a tavern by the people of Sagus Cliffs. Pipes lead deep underground, pumping a variety of fluids into the tavern. No one knows what the fluids are, but after some experimentation, they've learned which ones are relatively harmless and capable of intoxicating people. Veterans of countless psychic wars share ownership of the Fifth Eye, and they remain here at all hours. Something about the Fifth Eye's architecture serves to drown out the constant mental noise of the city. Their shared mental strength attracts strange beings from across the universe.</DefaultText>

Whenever she speaks, her words are softly echoed by the chittering voices of the Bloom, and she claims to understand what they are saying. She also claims to have met your sire, the Changing God, though that was many years ago. It's likely that she knows more about the Bloom and its secrets than anyone else alive.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Sorrow is an ancient horror that hunts the Changing God and all his creations – namely, the castoffs. When you woke deep in the Labyrinth of your mind, you felt the Sorrow's inexorable pressure as you rebuilt your memories. When you emerged into the Calm and spoke to the Specter, the Sorrow ripped its way into your mind and spilled its fragments into your psyche.</DefaultText>

He drew power from the other memories that were in your mind to summon you back to consciousness, activating your body's healing abilities when you fell from the sky. He's a valuable friend - of sorts – and a font of information.</DefaultText>

Walkways connect these platforms, crafted by humans using whatever unpleasant materials are close at hand, suspended above the Bloom's cavernous depths. Some platforms hold shrines, shops, or homes, including the Shrine of Great Chila.</DefaultText>

Further exploration seems warranted... especially because the Sorrow has infected you with its fragments.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Far to the west of Sagus Cliffs, past the trackless wastes and the Clock of Kala, the nine nations of the Steadfast form a nucleus of civilization centered around the Amber Papacy – the core of the Order of Truth. The nine kingdoms of the Steadfast are Navarene, Milave, Ghan, Thaemor, Draolis, Malevich, Ancuan, Iscobal, and the Pytharon Empire.

While the Steadfast is settled and civilized, it is still a dangerous place. Isolated communities are still threatened, and travel is risky. </DefaultText>
